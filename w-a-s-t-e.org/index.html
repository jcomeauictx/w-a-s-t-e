<p>W.A.S.T.E: "We await silent Tristero's empire."</p>

<p>From the novella <CITE>The Crying of Lot 49</CITE> by Thomas Pynchon; it's
a mail delivery system by hobos, of letters dropped in what appear to be trash
cans.</p>

<p>My goal with this website is to facilitate the decentralized adoption of
distributed network of people willing to deliver letters and packages cheaply
and efficiently; something that can replace government-run mail services
worldwide.</p>

<p>Each city or rural area can have any number of mail collectors, distributors,
and relayers. All 3 roles can be played by any individual, of course. The
distributors and collectors go door-to-door, dropping off and picking up
letters and packages, and the relayers take batches of it to other nearby hubs.
There will have to be a vetting system to reduce the likelihood of dishonest
people in our network. Hopefully the
<a href="https://kybyz.com/">kybyz project</a> can be built out to where it is
usable for that and for communication between hubs and individual agents.</p>

<p>One idea that occurred to me is that collectors in a particular city or
surrounding area can hold onto mail for destination areas until there is
enough to send by U.S. mail or other carrier cheaply to a distributor in that
city: say, Sam in San Francisco waits until he has 100 letters bound to
Chicago, then sends them in a package via UPS to Charlene for distribution.</p>
