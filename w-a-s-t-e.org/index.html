W.A.S.T.E: "We await silent Tristero's empire."

From the novella <CITE>The Crying of Lot 49</CITE> by Thomas Pynchon; it's
a mail delivery system by hobos, of letters dropped in what appear to be trash
cans.

My goal with this website is to facilitate the decentralized adoption of a
distributed network of people willing to deliver letters and packages cheaply
and efficiently; something that can replace government-run mail services
worldwide.
