The muted posthorn image can roughly be generated by moving 7 units to the
right; drawing a 7-unit circle clockwise; moving another 7 units to the right;
drawing an isosceles triangle with a 7-unit altitude. Then move 2.3 units to
the left, erase what's there and draw it again.

Noting that 2.3 is close to 1/3 of 7, make that 1 unit, and then the segments
are 3 units.
